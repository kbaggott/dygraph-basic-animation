# Dygraphs Basic Animation
A small function / snippet to allow basic animation on a dygraphs chart.

Takes each series and reduces by (editable) steps then grows them back up to original values.

--Note: this was just for my test case and is a work in progress, although may be helpful to someone as I couldn't find anything like it!
